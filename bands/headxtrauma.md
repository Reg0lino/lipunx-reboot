                <h2>About The Band</h2>
                <p>
                    HeadxTrauma was a fast hardcore/punk band from Long Island, NY. Formed in 2004, the band was active in the scene before fading out around 2007. They were known for a barrage of fast, heavy songs filled with angry, ironic, and sometimes nonsensical lyrics.

                    The band initially started as a straight edge band but eventually stopped representing that affiliation. They played shows frequently around Long Island and developed a dedicated "cult" following, as their raw sound stood in contrast to the style of music popular in much of the hardcore scene at that time.

                <h2>Where Are They Now?</h2>
                <p>
                    After the band's dissolution, the lead singer went on to create hip hop under the name "Big Breakfast." The other three members have all continued to be active in the Long Island scene, playing in multiple hardcore, punk, and pop-punk bands.
